Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

MUSA: It makes the code in each class more specific to that class alone. And honestly, for me, it makes coding so much easier because then I only have to think about how that class/object differs from its superclass and what methods/special attributes need to be included in it. The way I think of it is that the superclass acts as a base for all the other classes that come from it, the other classes just have more special functions for their contexts.


EVA: Inheritance more clearly connects classes to their methods by making the attributes and methods in each class particular to the class alone. It makes coding with multiple classes much easier to work on because every portion of the program feels more isolated, which also makes it easier to put together at the end to have the program run as a whole.


Angelica: Inheritance allows for communication between the classes. By using 'extends' in my code I can utilize the methods and attributes to create a hierarchy that better shows the relationships between the clasess. The superclass is useful because it simplifies the codes in the other classes

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

BOTH: 

Inheritance allowed us to think of all the classes as separate entities from each other, so it was really important that we kept all of the code separate. The only times our classes interacted was with the superclass, Building, in order to 'inherit' its attributes. This kept the assignment really straightfoward for us.

Trying to call parameters without this.[parameter name] attached would yeild errors because the program would not be able to understand that we were referring to the specific instance of the parameter.

We'd recommend that anyone doing the assignment follow the process as its ordered on the README file, as it allows you to work on the classes individually, which prevents the confusion that can pop when trying to program in multiple classes at once.
